This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

Dropdown menu exercise with React, TypeScript, and Sass.

The purpose of this exercise is to create an input and a table component in React to display type ahead information, and object data in a tabular format.

No state management app such as Redux was purposely not used.


## Code style guide

- We use [Hungarian variable notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation)
- For functions or global variables, the name should start with uppercase.
- For variables within a function, the name should start with lowercase.

- Pay attention to the linter!
- Use semicolons
- Two spaces
- Trailing commas where possible
- const or let over var

(Note, I am using the free tier and app will go to sleep after 1 hr of inactivity which will then require patience for the app to spin up again)
